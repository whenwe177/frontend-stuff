This repository is created to store several things I have done during my early forays in the front-end web development scene.

These are the files currently stored in the repo:

1. Formula 1 Championship Standings
I decided to design a simple frontend webpage using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS to show the current standings in Formula 1's Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. In the season I made this website, the championship has gone quite unpredictably and I really do believe that by creating this webpage it will be simpler to keep track of all the changes. Besides the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, data regarding previous race results is also presented. All the data are fetched from Ergast's Formula 1 API.
(Check out their website http://ergast.com/mrd/. The data they all store are quite cool actually...)

2. Tower of Hanoi Minigame
This Tower of Hanoi minigame is a simple frontend webpage using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. It implements drag and drop properties of Vanilla JS. The number of disks in the game can be set from 3 and up to 7. It has a stopwatch element as well, which will automatically stop when all the disks have been moved to a different peg (not the initial starting peg).
